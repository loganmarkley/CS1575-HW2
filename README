Homework #2

IMPORTANT:

1)
DO NOT modify any header files provided to you.

2)
Modify the sample '.gitignore' file to ignore any binary files you create.
It is bad practice to include executables in your git repo.

3)
Remember to add, commit, and push your submission files.

	git add FILENAME
	git commit -m "meaningful commit message"
	git push
